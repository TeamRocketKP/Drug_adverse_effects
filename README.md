# Classification of Severity of Drug adverse effects

The project idea was absorbed from the people that we see in our daily life. People are using different types of medicines for various diseases. Many of us know that these medicines will have side effects, but there is something that we need to look into, the adverse effects causing in long period of time. In this project, we would like to classify the severity of adverse drug effects.
